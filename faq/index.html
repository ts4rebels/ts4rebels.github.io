                        <dt>Google keeps saying: "This app is blocked. This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access".</dt>

                            <p>From your Google account Security settings, you have to turn on "Less secure app access". That is why we suggest you create a dummy account. You can read more about this <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255">here</a>.
                                This is not anything we can help with, as these are settings within your own personal account. We do not access any of your personal information. It is for the Google accounts to "talk to eachother".</p>

Our team sucessfully loaded/downloaded/etc The Vault with different accounts, old and new, and it works for us. There are a multitude of possibilities why it is isn't working for you and we're not going to troubleshoot every single one of them. Your issues could possibly stem from your antivirus programs, VPN and/or firewall set ups. Which none of our team are responsible for fixing or figuring out.<br><br>
