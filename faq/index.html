                        <dt>Google keeps saying: "This app is blocked. This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access".</dt>

                            <p>From your Google account Security settings, you have to turn on "Less secure app access". That is why we suggest you create a dummy account. You can read more about this <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255">here</a>.
                                This is not anything we can help with, as these are settings within your own personal account. We do not access any of your personal information. It is for the Google accounts to "talk to eachother".</p>
